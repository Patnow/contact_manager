INSTRUCTIONS PART 1

Thanks for all to read my work.

To use this simple program, you just have to put the main folder "contact_manager"
in your xAmp or Wamp folder corresponding to your localhost
(I use UwAmp, so my localhost's folder is "www").


INSTRUCTIONS PART 2

Once its done, open your browser and go to this page (if you are new to
coding) : localhost/contact_manager/html/contacts.html

You will have a simple page with a popup window coming up.


INSTRUCTIONS PART 3

The first thing to do do is to open the browser developper tool and
click on "Console". You will have text at this point in the console.

Click again on the field of the popup window and you will be asked to
enter three choices :
- 0 : to quit the program ;
- 1 : to see the contact list ;
- 2 : to add a new contact to the contact list ;


INSTRUCTIONS PART 4

If you try to enter something else than the given choices, the program
will show an error and will ask you for a new choice.

If you choose 2, the program will ask you the lastname and the firstname
of the new contact you want to add to the list throught popup windows. Once
it will be done, the program will alert a new message of the new contact
correctly added to the list and you will be asked to choose over the three
basic choice again until you decide to quit.

Enjoy!
