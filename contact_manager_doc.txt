INSTRUCTIONS PART 1

Thanks for all to read my work.

To use this simple program, you just have to put the main folder "contact_manager"
in your xAmp or Wamp folder corresponding to your localhost
(I use UwAmp, so my localhost's folder is "www").


INSTRUCTIONS PART 2

Once its done, open your browser and go to this page (if you are new to
coding) : localhost/contact_manager/html/contacts.html

You will have a simple page with a popup coming up.
