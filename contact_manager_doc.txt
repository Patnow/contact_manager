INSTRUCTIONS PART 1

Thanks for all to read my work.

To use this simple program, you just have to put the main folder "contact_manager"
in your xAmp or Wamp folder corresponding to your localhost
(I use UwAmp, so my localhost's folder is "www").


INSTRUCTIONS PART 2

Once its done, open your browser and go to this page (if you are new to
coding) : localhost/contact_manager/html/contacts.html

You will have a simple page with a popup window coming up.


INSTRUCTIONS PART 3 

The first thing to do do is to open the browser developper tool and 
click on "Console". You will have text at this point in the console. 

Click again on the field of the popup window and you will be asked to 
enter three choices : 
- 0 : to quit the program ;
- 1 : to see the contact list ; 
- 2 : to add a new contact to the contact list ;
